I feel that you shouldn't get involved in an intimate relationship until you are emotionally mature enough to handle it.
Totally able to cope with your feelings and your sexuality without guilt, inhibition or phoniness,
But with love, tenderness and honesty.

Things were disappearing in my neighborhood
Once again somebody was up to no good
I saw that you were wanted
But not like I wanted you
And that's when I knew I had to be with you
That's when I knew if I didn't, I'd be through
To end my grief, I'd have to catch a thief
Your love is my relief - my love is your relief

Come into my window, it's open every night
That's where I'll be waiting, I'll keep off all the lights
I'm lying on my bed, crown jewels on my head

I'd never give you up
So come in from the cold, my turtle dove
I'd hide you from the cops
Don't be frightened now, my love
I'll take a life of crime
All to make you mine

Come in off that roof top, you're so handsome dressed in black
Seen you in the shadows, like to see you on your back
Take this precious treasure, and I will treasure you

We'll run away my dear, some place special, have no fear
We'll even change our names, we'll be kinky, we'll be strange
I'll take a life of crime, all to make you mine

All to catch a thief
Your love is my relief - my love is your relief
Your love is my relief - my love is your relief
All to catch a thief
