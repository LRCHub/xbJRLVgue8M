You know the crowd was very small for a country music show
But he faked a curtain call just like it was years ago
And then a lady grabbed his arm as he staggered down the aisle
And with all his country charm he addressed her with a smile.
Would you catch a fallen star before he crashes to the ground
Don't you know how people are nobody loves you when you're down
Pick me up and take me home and I'll bring my old guitar
Sing a golden oldie song if you'll catch a fallen star.

He had a silver plated bus and a million country fans
Now there's just a few of us and he drives a little van
And they were beatin' down his door the lovely women left and right
And now he's on a hardwood floor a wonderin' where he'll spend the night
Would you catch a fallen star before he crashes to the ground
Don't you know how people are nobody loves you when you're down
Pick me up and take me home and I'll bring my old guitar
Sing a golden oldie song if you'll catch a fallen star
Sing a golden country song if you'll catch a fallen star.
