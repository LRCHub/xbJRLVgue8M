I caught a glimpse
And I smile
Catch my eye
I caught a glimpse
And I smile
Catch my eye

Catch my eye

Catch my eye

We're strange, you and I
Forever smiling
We found each other
Caught up in the moment
For years and years
We're strange
But we, we get by
We adopt each others
Ways of walking
We unload our fears

Catch my eye
Catch my eye

I caught a glimpse
And I smile
Catch my eye
I caught a glimpse
And I smile
Catch my eye

Were running round in circles
There's a tug of war with your heart strings
Playing too many games
But I cant help gambling
We've got nothing to loose
We will self destruct
What goes up must down
You fit me like a glove
You are the only one

We're Strange
But we
We're Strange

We're Strange
But we
We're Strange

And I smile
Catch my eye
I caught a glimpse
And I smile
Catch my eye

I caught a glimpse
And I smile
Catch my eye
